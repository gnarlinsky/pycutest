Come join us at the Champaign Public Library, in our regular room this time
(Robeson Pavilion Room C, first floor lobby area, right across from the
coffeeshop stand), 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM.

**The agenda includes:**

* **Main presentation**

  Austin Rochford will talk about probabilistic programming with <a
  href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymc">PyMC</a>.

* **Choosing a new meeting time/day**

  Since we started Py-CU last February, our General Meetings have been every
  other Friday. Of course, this doesnâ€™t work for everyone so we put up a Doodle
  poll and the majority of the votes given went to Monday nights. However,
  Nadia and Liz will be busy with the Python Beginner Tutorial series until the
  end of October. We need to figure out whether we will keep our General
  Meetings on Fridays until the series is over or if there are people who can
  fill in and lead meetings temporarily, through the end of October. *So if there is anyone who is willing
  to lead meetings on Mondays after our September 27 meeting, please email us
  <a href="mailto:info@py-cu.org?Subject=Temporarily%20leading%20PyCU%20meetings">info@py-cu.org</a>!*


* **Birds of a Feather sessions**
